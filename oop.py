# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
# OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.
from qrcode import make


class User:
    def __init__(self, username, email, password):
        self.username = username
        self._email = email
        self.password = password

    @property
    def email(self):
        print("Getting email...")
        return self._email

    @email.setter
    def email(self, new_email):
        print("Setting email...")
        if "@" in new_email:
            self._email = new_email
        else:
            print("Invalid email address")


# user1 = User("john", "john@example.com", "password123")
# user1.email = "this is not a valid@ email"
# print(user1.email)


# In the above code, we have defined a User class with an __init__ method that initializes the username, email, and password attributes. We have also defined a property for the email attribute, which allows us to control how the email is accessed and modified. The email setter checks if the new email address contains an "@" symbol before updating the _email attribute.
class User:
    user_count = 0

    def __init__(self, username, email, password):
        self.username = username
        self._email = email
        self.password = password
        User.user_count += 1

    def display_user_info(self):
        print(f"Username: {self.username}, Email: {self._email}")


# user1 = User("john", "john@example.com", "password123")
# print(f"Total users: {User.user_count}")
# user2 = User("jane", "jane@example.com", "password456")
# print(f"Total users: {User.user_count}")


# In this code, we have added a class variable user_count to keep track of the number of User instances created. Each time a new User is initialized, we increment the user_count by 1. We also have a method display_user_info that prints the username and email of the user.
class BankAccount:
    MIN_BALANCE = 100

    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self._balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if self._is_valid_deposit(amount):
            self._balance += amount
            self.__log_transaction("deposit", amount)
        else:
            print("Deposit amount must be positive")

    def _is_valid_deposit(self, amount):
        return amount > 0

    def __log_transaction(self, transaction_type, amount):
        print(f"Logging {transaction_type} of ${amount}. New balance: ${self._balance}")

    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_interest_rate(rate):
        return 0 <= rate <= 5


# account1 = BankAccount("Alice", 500)
# account1.deposit(200)

# print(BankAccount.is_valid_interest_rate(3))
# print(BankAccount.is_valid_interest_rate(13))


#! Encapsulation is the principle of hiding the internal state and behavior of an object and only exposing a public interface. This is often achieved using private attributes and methods, which are denoted by a leading underscore (_). In the BankAccount class, we have made the balance attribute private by prefixing it with an underscore. We also have a public method deposit that allows us to modify the balance, but we control how it can be modified through the _is_valid_deposit method. Additionally, we have a private method __log_transaction that is used to log transactions whenever a deposit is made.
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self._balance = 0.0

    @property
    def balance(self):
        return self._balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self._balance += amount
        else:
            raise ValueError("Deposit amount must be positive.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self._balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds.")
        elif amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Withdrawal amount must be positive.")
        else:
            self._balance -= amount


# account = BankAccount()
# print(account.balance) # Output: 0.0
# account.deposit(100)
# print(account.balance) # Output: 100.0
# account.withdraw(30)
# print(account.balance) # Output: 70.0


#! Abstraction is the principle of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object. In the BankAccount class, we have abstracted away the internal workings of how the balance is managed and how transactions are logged. The user of the BankAccount class does not need to know how the balance is stored or how transactions are logged; they only need to interact with the public methods deposit and withdraw to manage their account balance.


class EmailService:
    def _connect(self):
        print("Connecting to email server...")

    def _authenticate(self):
        print("Authenticating...")

    def sendEmail(self):
        self._connect()
        self._authenticate()
        print("Sending email...")
        self._disconnect()

    def _disconnect(self):
        print("Disconnecting from email server...")


# email = EmailService()
# email.sendEmail()

#! Inheritance is a fundamental principle of OOP that allows a new class (called a child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (called a parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchical relationship between classes.


class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine started....")

    def stop_engine(self):
        print("Engine stopped!")


class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year, num_doors, num_wheels=4):
        super().__init__(brand, model, year)
        self.num_doors = num_doors
        self.num_wheels = num_wheels

    def honk(self):
        print("Honk! Honk!")


class Bike(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year, has_pedals=False, num_wheels=2):
        super().__init__(brand, model, year)
        self.has_pedals = has_pedals
        self.num_wheels = num_wheels

    def ring_bell(self):
        print("Ring! Ring!")


# car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020, 4)
car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020, 4)

# bike = Bike("Trek", "Marlin 7", 2021, has_pedals=True)
bike = Bike("Trek", "Marlin 7", 2021, has_pedals=True)

# print(car.__dict__)
# print(bike.__dict__)

#! Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In the context of OOP, it allows us to use a single interface to represent different underlying data types or classes. In the example above, both Car and Bike classes inherit from the Vehicle class, and they can be treated as instances of Vehicle. This means we can call the start_engine method on both Car and Bike objects, even though they are different types of vehicles. This is an example of polymorphism in action.


class Motorcycle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def start_bike(self):
        print("Motorcycle engine started...")

    def stop_bike(self):
        print("Motorcycle engine stopped!")


# create a list of vehicles
vehicles = [
    Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020, 4),
    Motorcycle("Harley-Davidson", "Street 750", 2021),
]
# loop through the list and call the start_engine method on each vehicle
for vehicle in vehicles:
    if isinstance(vehicle, Car):
        print(f"Inspecting car: {vehicle.brand} {vehicle.model}")
        vehicle.start_engine()
        vehicle.honk()
    elif isinstance(vehicle, Motorcycle):
        print(f"Inspecting motorcycle: {vehicle.brand} {vehicle.model}")
        vehicle.start_bike()
        vehicle.stop_bike()
    else:
        print(f"Unknown vehicle type: {vehicle.brand} {vehicle.model}")
